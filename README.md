# MorseCodeFunctions
Set of Morse Code Functions for Arduino, with Hello World!


Set of functions for A-Z, some accented letters, 0-9 and Procedural Signs in Morse Code.

Includes an example of Hello World! in Morse Code.

You can use a piezo buzzer, LED or both.

This is a fairly simple sketch with examples of nested functions.

Our next step for this Sketch is to turn it into a library.
